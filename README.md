# coredoc
Fast static documentation/site generator written in C

## Installing
See [INSTALL](INSTALL)

## Why?
Most modern site generators are over complicated, and take a long time to build.
Coredoc fixes this by being a fast, and lightweight documentation or static site generator.
It will never support super complex templating languages, javascript, or some other over complicated technology

## Documentation
Coming soon!!
